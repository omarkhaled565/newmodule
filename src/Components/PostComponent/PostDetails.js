        <p className='paragraph'>Newspapers are an important part of our life. Some people cannot start their day without reading newspapers. They are printed in various languages and even in local languages. Newspapers are delivered to our doorsteps every morning. Newspapers are one of the easiest methods of spreading news and information around the world. There might be those who read every single news article, irrespective of what they speak about. There are also people who read only what interests them. For some, it might be politics; for some, it might be sports; while for others, it might be technology. Though the number of people subscribing to printed newspapers is reducing day by day, there are still some who prefer reading them rather than the digital versions of the news on their personal phones or laptops
            Due to the severe scarcity and cost of paper, print media has pushed people to switch to reading digital news. The internet’s presence has made things easier. We can learn about the state of the planet simply by pressing a button. We may need to know and understand weather conditions a number of times. Previously, newspapers would bring this to us. We may now check the news on our gadgets to learn about current weather conditions throughout the world. News is also broadcasted on radio and television in live and recorded forms.

            Cultivating the habit of reading a newspaper would prove beneficial in not just updating your knowledge about everything that is happening around the world but also in helping you improve your vocabulary and language on the whole.
            Newspapers have their own importance in the world. Newspaper publishing companies have now built applications or websites that allow users all over the world to access them. Current events and general knowledge can be learned by reading instructive articles in newspapers on a daily basis. There are a number of popular English newspapers published in India. Some of them are The Hindu, Hindustan Times, The Indian Express and The Times of India. Each newspaper has a different style of presentation though they speak about the same events/happenings from around the world.

            Now, what interests a person; why do they read newspapers? There are people who feel their morning tea/coffee is incomplete without a newspaper. In addition to all the news from around the world, a newspaper also includes a variety of puzzles, comics and riddles. Supplements with such miscellaneous articles, stories and puzzles interest many. There are also supplements which focus solely on the economic developments, opportunities for work and study, what’s new in cinema and so on. Youngsters and kids seem to love these more than the main newspaper.

            What most of us don’t really think about is the time and effort put into publishing a newspaper every single day. It is due to the relentless work of writers, journalists, news reporters, editors and the printing presses that we have been able to receive newspapers first thing in the morning, without fail.</p>
